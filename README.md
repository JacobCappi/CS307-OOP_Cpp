# CS-307-Projects

Code that seems to work okay, but needs a lot of work. Much of the code feels like spaghetti code, so I want to touch up this code and properly use pointers as a possible summer project.

1. First code, no design pattern -- just basic OOP in C++ to get flight data and aircraft data from .xml files and calculate some basic statistics to print to display.

2. Attempted to implement abstract factory, flywieght, and singleton. Code was a mess b/c I couldn't understand how to properly use the parser at the time. I also didn't use pointers -- I got annoyed at things not working for seemingly no reason... Will fix and properly use new / delete (or C11 smart pointers) over the summer.

Note: These aren't the completed copies, as I moved over to Visual Studio to test the software on a windows system and made many edits there.
